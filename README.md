# Excalidraw Desktop

Welcome to the unofficial desktop version of Excalidraw, a highly regarded web-based sketching tool that's beloved for
its simplicity and power in creating diagrams. This desktop iteration is built with Tauri, aiming to bring the seamless
and intuitive drawing experience of Excalidraw directly to your desktop for offline use.

## Introduction

Excalidraw's charm lies in its ease of use, enabling users to sketch diagrams that resemble hand-drawn ones, yet with
the precision and flexibility of digital tools. Recognizing the potential for an offline version that can be used
without internet connectivity, this project serves as a preliminary effort to make Excalidraw accessible as a desktop
application. It's a quick port that retains the essence and simplicity of the original web application, without
significant changes to its core functionality.

## Disclaimer

This desktop version of Excalidraw is an independent project and not officially associated with the Excalidraw team.
It's developed as a personal initiative to explore the possibilities of an offline version. While it has been tested and
works for personal use, its functionality is not guaranteed for all systems or use cases. Feedback and contributions are
welcome to improve its compatibility and features.
